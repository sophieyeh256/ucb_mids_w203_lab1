# Importance and Context

The 2020 election was a tense election with a heated political environment and threats to citizen safety and the US economy at play. The overall impact was that while past elections may have had polarizing issues or candidates affecting voter turnout, the 2020 election occurred during social unrest with an actual deadly virus threatening voters from turning out at the polls amid lockdowns. 

Also, during November of 2020, vaccines were not prevalent, with only clinical participants receiving the required dosages to have potential immunity against the virus. Thus, the first portion of our analysis seeks to answer which side of the political spectrum experienced more difficulty voting during the 2020 election. The specific research question our analysis will answer is:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*“Did Democratic or Republican voters experience more difficulty voting in the 2020 election?”*

By answering this question with an understanding of the environment in which voters were casting their ballots, and creating clear definitions as to what a “Voter”, “Democrat” and “Republican” are. It’s desired that the data and analysis can help readers understand more about how voters who side with a particular party can experience potentially increased difficulty in voting.
